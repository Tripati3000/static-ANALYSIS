# STATIC ANALYSIS 👍
- Get Malware samples which you want and download it (Go snd copy paste it to browser to download) - [Malware](https://urlhaus.abuse.ch/browse/)
- Download [HXD](https://github.com/Tripati3000/Malware-ANALYSIS/blob/main/HxDSetup.zip) to configure the keywrods and paste the malware file on it. 
- Find keywords - **4D,5A,MZ,This program cannot be run on DOS mode**
- If these keywords the file may have then it is a malware because if it is any kind like Jpeg,jpg,pdf,exe or anything else these keywords are there and it means it is executable.
- if we do any changes like making jpeg to exe or anykind of changes, the file will not change❌
